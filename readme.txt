This project is a challenge from "Frontend Mentor". 
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5.

This project was build with:

1. html
2. css
3. javaScript
4. Tailwind.css

Things IÂ´ve learned

-Tailwind is an awsome tool to help you spend less time in the styling
and more time in the Html and javaScript, making sure your page work as you intended
-Tailwind is also a great tool for reponsive desings
-I learned how to create a carousel with animations that responds to arrow buttons
-I learned how to use javaScript to validate an email and send either a 
successful or an error message according to the input received.
-Overall i feel more comfortable in my habilities to create pages only by looking at them
-I have a better undestanding in how the responsive desing works and how to create responsive elements

For future Projects

-I want to master tailwind.css until i can build everyting with this framework
-I want to lear how to create other types of carousels as they are very useful to show information
-I will continue practicing javaScript so i can become better at writing and understanding the code
